# SIMPLE NOTE APP

A minimalist note-taking web app build by the minimalist, for the minimalist. This web app is created using only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. No libaries or frameworks were used.

## Live Demo

## User story
Here's what the user can do with the app.

1. A user can open a new note by clicking "New" button.

2. When a user finish writing a content and clicked a "Create" button, it will spawn a saved note below.

3. A user can edit the saved content by clicking the edit ":" button on the right side of the note. When the sign is "âœ“", it indicates that the saved content is editable and when the sign is ":", it indicates that the saved content is not editable.

4. A user can delete the saved note by clicking the delete "x" button.

5. A saved note can be stored in the local storage by pressing the "Save" button. A message reading "Edits saved" will appear. When a page is refreshed or closed the tab, the saved notes is still there.

## Issues that need to solved

As a beginner programmer, there are a lot of things that can be improved to this project and they are included, but not limited to:

-  When a note is created, it should be uneditable by default. You'll notice the button on the right is tick mark and it's already editable. Consequently, when you delete the note when there is tick mark, the blank page is still editable as well.

- Design problem - If you look carefully both in my source code and the app itself, you'll see that the textarea and note lists are not perfectly aligned together and they're off by few meters on the right side of the screen. There's got to be better way to do it without manually tweaking the code until it looks better. (If you still don't get the problem, I'll attach a photo below shortly).

#### Any further comments and suggestions to make the project better are appreicated.
